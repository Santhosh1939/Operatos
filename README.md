# Operatos
PYTHON OPERATORS PRACTICE FILE
Operators are special symbols in Python that perform operations on values and variables, and they are fundamental for performing calculations, comparisons, and logical operations. Here's a breakdown of the different types of operators in Python:
Arithmetic Operators:
Used for mathematical calculations.
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
// (floor division - returns the integer part of the division)
% (modulus - returns the remainder of the division)
** (exponentiation)
Assignment Operators:
Used to assign values to variables.
= (simple assignment)
+= (add and assign)
-= (subtract and assign)
*= (multiply and assign)
/= (divide and assign)
//= (floor divide and assign)
%= (modulus and assign)
**= (exponentiate and assign)
Comparison Operators:
Used to compare values.
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)
Logical Operators:
Used to combine or modify boolean expressions.
and (returns True if both operands are True)
or (returns True if at least one operand is True)
not (returns the opposite of the operand's boolean value)
Bitwise Operators:
Used to perform operations on individual bits of data.
& (AND)
| (OR)
^ (XOR)
~ (NOT)
<< (left shift)
>> (right shift)
Identity Operators:
Used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory. 
is (returns True if both variables are the same object)
is not (returns True if both variables are not the same object)
Membership Operators:
Used to check if a value is present in a sequence (e.g., string, list, tuple).
in (returns True if the value is found in the sequence)
not in (returns True if the value is not found in the sequence)
